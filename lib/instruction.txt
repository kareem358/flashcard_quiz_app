Now before moving to Ui design first lets make some constant  vatriable
- create a separate file

-lets start creating the homepage
-first delete all the default code and start from scratch

-lets start work on UI
-change the background color and the appbar first
-import the constant dart file in our homepage . because it has our colors

- lets add some demo question
- now lets create our question widget
- lts add it to out homepage
- we can change the style of the question
- with that our question widget is ready

- next i am gonna create the next question button(floating one)
- add it to the homeScreen where  it is needed
- adding some functionalities to it
- like on clicking next question will show
- doing so we need to pass  a function that will do all the work
- the next button will show an error becuse the index increment with the next button
  will exceed the question number and will not find the required index
- to fix this add some condition
- now it will be fixed and if the list will ended , the button will show nothing
