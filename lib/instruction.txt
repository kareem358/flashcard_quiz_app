Now before moving to Ui design first lets make some constant  vatriable
- create a separate file

-lets start creating the homepage
-first delete all the default code and start from scratch

-lets start work on UI
-change the background color and the appbar first
-import the constant dart file in our homepage . because it has our colors

- lets add some demo question
- now lets create our question widget
- lts add it to out homepage
- we can change the style of the question
- with that our question widget is ready

- next i am gonna create the next question button(floating one)
- add it to the homeScreen where  it is needed
- adding some functionalities to it
- like on clicking next question will show
- doing so we need to pass  a function that will do all the work
- the next button will show an error becuse the index increment with the next button
  will exceed the question number and will not find the required index
- to fix this add some condition
- now it will be fixed and if the list will ended , the button will show nothing

- next lets add the options
- in the home screen below the divider where the for loop and card is added
- lets create our custom widget for the option
- then add it to the homeScreen
- make them clickable.
- we need to change the color when option being clicked...
- we cant let know the user for the correct answer even before he select anything ,
  or he may clicked the desired option as his selected answer .
- lets add some condition about it, if the user has clicked then change the color
  otherwise don't change the color.
- now this is fixed , just adding the function for when the isPressed value change.
- now here another problem , when the next button is pressed the value of isPressed
  is  unchanged so its shows all the answers like before when it is clicked
- lets fixed this, in the nextQuestion function
- the problem is fixed now....

now a little problem here
you see that when a user clicks the next button then he can go to the next question
even though even that he did not select any option , we don't want that . we want if a user didn't
select any option , the app will a message the he has to select at least one option to continue .
lets do this ...
it is fixed now ..

- lets add some score to show in our app.
- adding some functions to increase the score value
- when the user select the correct answer , the score value will be increased by 1.
- let remove the gesture detector widget from the optionCard and put it in the parent widget.

- changeColor Function to CheckAnswerAndUpdate function passing a bool value.
- now the problem is here that the score value is increasing even when the answer is selected
  means if we select the right option twice score will be increased by 2. now fixed that.
  lets make the value of isAlreadySelected bool false when the nextQuestion is appeared
  with next button.
  its working now ...

- everything is okay now moving further and polish our app step wise (8)
  when the color of the optionCard is changed , it difficult to read the wording in the red
  area of  different options
  so we will make sure the color change of the text as well when the option color is changed ..
  how it will work
  0xFFE31818
  0xFF28DD5E
  these combination are of the same for blue
  if we provide there does not have the same combination of red and green then it
  will be the neutral color we will created before and the text color will return the  black and
  if the color red and green appear the text color will turn into the  neutral means white.


- now lets create a result box for the score, at the end of our quiz.will show user result
- lets create our dialog box in a separate file (in a widget form )
- with this our result box is completed ....

- now lets add a button to start the quiz from start
- now we need a function to , which function is to restart the quiz.
  creating it in the home page
- now here we have one more problem that we can't select the wrong option
  the problem is fixed with all its aspect and need

- now looking forward to polished and refine the app while adding some other features
- working on database so visit the "firebase.google.com".
